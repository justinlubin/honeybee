ComBat-seq is a batch effect adjustment tool for bulk RNA-seq count data.
It is an improved model based on the popular

to address its limitations through novel methods designed specifically for
RNA-Seq studies.  ComBat-seq takes untransformed, raw count matrix as
input. Same as ComBat, it requires a known batch variable.

We use a negative binomial regression to model batch effects, then provide
adjusted data by mapping the original data to an expected distribution if
there were no batch effects. This approach better captures the properties
of RNA-Seq count data compared to the Gaussian distribution assumed by
ComBat. ComBat-seq specifies different dispersion parameters across
batches, allowing for flexible modeling of the variance of gene expression.
In addition, ComBat-seq provides adjusted data which preserves the integer
nature of counts, so that the adjusted data are compatible with the
assumptions of state-of-the-art differential expression software (e.g.
edgeR, DESeq2, which specifically request untransformed count data).
